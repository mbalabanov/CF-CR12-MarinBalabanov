## Description
This is a WordPress theme for a travel agency as an exercise for CodeFactory. The underlying structure is based on the model theme available on underscore.me.

The design is based on the requirements defined by CodeFactory in Code Review 12. The initial design was created using Bootstrap and can be found here as flat HTML https://github.com/mbalabanov/CF-CR12-MarinBalabanov/tree/main/boostrap-model

The final theme does not use Bootstrap but adheres to the requirements. The theme's files can be found in the repository. The layout files are adapted and the custom CSS is in styles-custom.css.

## Installation
The whole theme is available as a ZIP file here: https://github.com/mbalabanov/CF-CR12-MarinBalabanov/blob/main/CF-CR12-MarinBalabanov.zip

Download the ZIP file and uncompress it into the WordPress themes folder. Then select and activate the theme in the appearance menu.
